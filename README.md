# Walmart-API-Integration-Data-Scraper
This project focuses on extracting detailed product information from Walmart, combining web scraping with API integration to maximize accuracy and speed.

I implemented:

Direct API requests to access product data in clean JSON format.

Scrapyâ€™s pipelining system to process and store results efficiently.

A filtering-ready dataset containing key details like product name, price, category, rating, and availability.

The result was a high-volume, structured dataset optimized for analysis, best-deals extraction, and public sharing.
